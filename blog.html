                <h2>1. What are the differnces between local storage and session storage?</h2>
                <p><strong>Local storage</strong> and Session storage are the storages the browser gives us. <strong>Local storage </strong> is permanent and has no expire date. But <strong>Session storage </strong>is temporary.It expires with closing the tab.</p>

                <h2>2. What are the differnces between global scope and block scope?</h2>
                <p><strong>Global scope</strong> means the variables or functions that we can access from anywhere of the code.But <strong>Block scope</strong> can not be accessed outside of its scope.But a child scope can access its parents although the parent scope can not access its childs. So here is a example like variable decalred with <strong>var</strong> keyword can be accessed from anywhere of the whole code. But variable decalred in a function with the keyword <strong>const</strong> or <strong>let</strong> can not be accessed from out of that function.</p>

                <h2>3. What is javascript event loop?</h2>
                <p>Javascript is single threaded language but it can run ascynchronusly too. In the run time js does its tasks one by one but if there is asynchronus task, js sends it to a queue and whenever its done , it comes back to the stack and gives the output.This whole complicated process which is hard to explain in writing blog, is called event loop. </p>

                <h2>4. How can we get "undefined"?</h2>
                <p>You will get undefined value when you call a non-existent property or method of an object. In the above example, a function Sum does not return any result but still we try to assign its resulted value to a variable. So in this case, result will be undefined.</p>
